          White people in North America live in a social environment that
          protects and insulates them from race-based stress.1 Fine (1997)
          identifies this insulation when she observes “… how Whiteness accrues
          privilege and status; gets itself surrounded by protective pillows of
          resources and/or benefits of the doubt; how Whiteness repels gossip
          and voyeurism and instead demands dignity” (p. 57). Whites are rarely
          without these “protective pillows,” and when they are, it is usually
          temporary and by choice. This insulated environment of racial
          privilege builds white expectations for racial comfort while at the
          same time lowering the ability to tolerate racial stress.

            For many white people, a single required multicultural education
            course taken in college, or required “cultural competency training”
            in their workplace, is the only time they may encounter a direct and
            sustained challenge to their racial understandings. But even in this
            arena, not all multicultural courses or training programs talk
            directly about racism, much less address white privilege. It is far
            more the norm for these courses and programs to use racially coded
            language such as “urban,” “inner city,” and “disadvantaged” but to
            rarely use “white” or “overadvantaged” or “privileged.” This
            racially coded language reproduces racist images and perspectives
            while it simultaneously reproduces the comfortable illusion that
            race and its problems are what “they” have, not us. Reasons why the
            facilitators of these courses and trainings may not directly name
            the dynamics and beneficiaries of racism range from the lack of a
            valid analysis of racism by white facilitators, personal and
            economic survival strategies for facilitators of color, and the
            overall pressure from management to keep the content comfortable and
            palatable for whites. However, if and when an educational program
            does directly address racism and the privileging of whites, common
            white responses include anger, withdrawal, emotional incapacitation,
            guilt, argumentation, and cognitive dissonance (all of which
            reinforce the pressure on facilitators to avoid directly addressing
            racism). So-called progressive whites may not respond with anger,
            but may still insulate themselves via claims that they are beyond
            the need for engaging with the content because they “already had a
            class on this” or “already know this.” These reactions are often
            seen in anti-racist education endeavors as forms of resistance to
            the challenge of internalized dominance (Whitehead & Wittig, 2005;
            Horton & Scott, 2004; McGowan, 2000, O’Donnell, 1998). These
            reactions do indeed function as resistance, but it may be useful to
            also conceptualize them as the result of the reduced psychosocial
            stamina that racial insulation inculcates. I call this lack of
            racial stamina “White Fragility.”
