        <i>I am a white woman. I am standing beside a black woman. We are facing a group of white

        people who are seated in front of us. We are in their

        workplace, and have been hired by their employer

        to lead them in a dialogue about race. The room is

        filled with tension and charged with hostility. I have

        just presented a definition of racism that includes

        the acknowledgment that whites hold social and

        institutional power over people of color. A white man

        is pounding his fist on the table.</i>
