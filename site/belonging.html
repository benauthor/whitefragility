        White people enjoy a deeply internalized, largely unconscious sense of
        racial belonging in U.S. society27. This racial belonging is instilled
        via the whiteness embedded in the culture at large. Everywhere we look,
        we see our own racial image reflected back to us – in our heroes and
        heroines, in standards of beauty, in our role-models and teachers, in
        our textbooks and historical memory, in the media, in religious
        iconography including the image of god himself, etc. In virtually any
        situation or image deemed valuable in dominant society, whites belong.
        Indeed, it is rare for most whites to experience a sense of not
        belonging, and such experiences are usually very temporary, easily
        avoidable situations. Racial belonging becomes deeply internalized and
        taken for granted. In dominant society, interruption of racial belonging
        is rare and thus destabilizing and frightening to whites.

        Whites consistently choose and enjoy racial segregation. Living,
        working, and playing in racial segregation is unremarkable as long as it
        is not named or made explicitly intentional. For example, in many
        anti-racist endeavors, a common exercise is to separate into caucus
        groups by race in order to discuss issues specific to your racial group,
        and without the pressure or stress of other groups’ presence. Generally,
        people of color appreciate this opportunity for racial fellowship, but
        white people typically become very uncomfortable, agitated and upset -
        even though this temporary separation is in the service of addressing
        racism. Responses include a disorienting sense of themselves as not just
        people, but most particularly white people; a curious sense of loss
        about this contrived and temporary separation which they don’t feel
        about the real and on-going segregation in their daily lives; and
        anxiety about not knowing what is going on in the groups of color. The
        irony, again, is that most whites live in racial segregation every day,
        and in fact, are the group most likely to intentionally choose that
        segregation (albeit obscured in racially coded language such as seeking
        “good schools” and “good neighborhoods”). This segregation is
        unremarkable until it is named as deliberate – i.e. “We are now going to
        separate by race for a short exercise.”I posit that it is the
        intentionality that is so disquieting – as long as we don’t mean to
        separate, as long as it “just happens” that we live segregated lives, we
        can maintain a (fragile) identity of racial innocence.
