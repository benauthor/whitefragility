        Ideological racism includes strongly positive images of the white self
        as well as strongly negative images of racial “others”25. This
        self-image engenders a self-perpetuating sense of entitlement because
        many whites believe their financial and professional successes are the
        result of their own efforts while ignoring the fact of white privilege.
        Because most whites have not been trained to think complexly about
        racism in schools26 or mainstream discourse, and because it benefits
        white dominance not to do so, we have a very limited understanding of
        racism. Yet dominance leads to racial arrogance, and in this racial
        arrogance, whites have no compunction about debating the knowledge of
        people who have thought complexly about race. Whites generally feel free
        to dismiss these informed perspectives rather than have the humility to
        acknowledge that they are unfamiliar, reflect on them further, or seek
        more information. This intelligence and expertise are often trivialized
        and countered with simplistic platitudes (i.e. “People just need to…”).

        Because of white social, economic and political power within a white
        dominant culture, whites are positioned to legitimize people of color’s
        assertions of racism. Yet whites are the least likely to see,
        understand, or be invested in validating those assertions and being
        honest about their consequences, which leads whites to claim that they
        disagree with perspectives that challenge their worldview, when in fact,
        they don’t understand the perspective.Thus, they confuse not
        understanding with not agreeing. This racial arrogance, coupled with the
        need for racial comfort, also has whites insisting that people of color
        explain white racism in the “right” way. The right way is generally
        politely and rationally, without any show of emotional upset. When
        explained in a way that white people can see and understand, racism’s
        validity may be granted (references to dynamics of racism that white
        people do not understand are usually rejected out of hand). However,
        whites are usually more receptive to validating white racism if that
        racism is constructed as residing in individual white people other than
        themselves.
