        White Fragility is a state in which even a minimum amount of racial
        stress becomes intolerable, triggering a range of defensive moves. These
        moves include the outward display of emotions such as anger, fear, and
        guilt, and behaviors such as argumentation, silence, and leaving the
        stress-inducing situation. These behaviors, in turn, function to
        reinstate white racial equilibrium. Racial stress results from an
        interruption to what is racially familiar. These interruptions can take
        a variety of forms and come from a range of sources, including:

        Suggesting that a white person’s viewpoint comes from a racialized frame
        of reference (challenge to objectivity);
        People of color talking directly about their racial perspectives
        (challenge to white racial codes);
        People of color choosing not to protect the racial feelings of white
        people in regards to race (challenge to white racial expectations and
        need/entitlement to racial comfort);
        People of color not being willing to tell their stories or answer
        questions about their racial experiences (challenge to colonialist
        relations);
        A fellow white not providing agreement with one’s interpretations
        (challenge to white solidarity);
        Receiving feedback that one’s behavior had a racist impact (challenge to
        white liberalism);
        Suggesting that group membership is significant (challenge to
        individualism);
        An acknowledgment that access is unequal between racial groups
        (challenge to meritocracy);
        Being presented with a person of color in a position of leadership
        (challenge to white authority);
        Being presented with information about other racial groups through, for
        example, movies in which people of color drive the action but are not in
        stereotypical roles, or multicultural education (challenge to white
        centrality).
        In a white dominant environment, each of these challenges becomes
        exceptional. In turn, whites are often at a loss for how to respond in
        constructive ways. Whites have not had to build the cognitive or
        affective skills or develop the stamina that would allow for
        constructive engagement across racial divides. Bourdieu’s concept of
        habitus10 may be useful here. According to Bourdieu, habitus is a
        socialized subjectivity; a set of dispositions which generate practices
        and perceptions. As such, habitus only exists in, through and because of
        the practices of actors and their interaction with each other and with
        the rest of their environment. Based on the previous conditions and
        experiences that produce it, habitus produces and reproduces thoughts,
        perceptions, expressions and actions. Strategies of response to
        “disequilibrium” in the habitus are not based on conscious
        intentionality but rather result from unconscious dispositions towards
        practice, and depend on the power position the agent occupies in the
        social structure. White Fragility may be conceptualized as a product of
        the habitus, a response or “condition” produced and reproduced by the
        continual social and material advantages of the white structural
        position.

        Omi & Winant posit the U.S. racial order as an “unstable equilibrium,”
        kept equilibrated by the State, but still unstable due to continual
        conflicts of interests and challenges to the racial order11. Using Omi &
        Winant’s concept of unstable racial equilibrium, white privilege can be
        thought of as unstable racial equilibrium at the level of habitus. When
        any of the above triggers (challenges in the habitus) occur, the
        resulting disequilibrium becomes intolerable. Because White Fragility
        finds its support in and is a function of white privilege, fragility and
        privilege result in responses that function to restore equilibrium and
        return the resources “lost” via the challenge - resistance towards the
        trigger, shutting down and/or tuning out, indulgence in emotional
        incapacitation such as guilt or “hurt feelings”, exiting, or a
        combination of these responses.
