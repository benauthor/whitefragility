        The first factor leading to White Fragility is the segregated lives
        which most white people live12. Even if whites live in physical
        proximity to people of color (and this would be exceptional outside of
        an urban or temporarily mixed class neighborhood), segregation occurs on
        multiple levels, including representational and informational. Because
        whites live primarily segregated lives in a white-dominated society,
        they receive little or no authentic information about racism and are
        thus unprepared to think about it critically or with complexity. Growing
        up in segregated environments (schools, workplaces, neighborhoods, media
        images and historical perspectives), white interests and perspectives
        are almost always central. An inability to see or consider significance
        in the perspectives of people of color results13. Further, white people
        are taught not to feel any loss over the absence of people of color in
        their lives and in fact, this absence is what defines their schools and
        neighborhoods as “good;” whites come to understand that a “good school”
        or “good neighborhood” is coded language for “white”14. The quality of
        white space being in large part measured via the absence of people of
        color (and Blacks in particular) is a profound message indeed, one that
        is deeply internalized and reinforced daily through normalized
        discourses about good schools and neighborhoods. This dynamic of gain
        rather than loss via racial segregation may be the most profound aspect
        of white racial socialization of all. Yet, while discourses about what
        makes a space good are tacitly understood as racially coded, this coding
        is explicitly denied by whites.
