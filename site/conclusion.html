        White people often believe that multicultural / anti-racist education is
        only necessary for those who interact with “minorities” or in “diverse”
        environments. However, the dynamics discussed here suggest that it is
        critical that all white people build the stamina to sustain conscious
        and explicit engagement with race. When whites posit race as
        non-operative because there are few, if any, people of color in their
        immediate environments, Whiteness is reinscribed ever more deeply45.
        When whites only notice “raced others,” we reinscribe Whiteness by
        continuing to posit Whiteness as universal and non Whiteness as other.
        Further, if we can’t listen to or comprehend the perspectives of people
        of color, we cannot bridge cross-racial divides. A continual retreat
        from the discomfort of authentic racial engagement results in a
        perpetual cycle that works to hold racism in place.
        <br>
        <br>
        While anti-racist efforts ultimately seek to transform institutionalized
        racism, anti-racist education may be most effective by starting at the
        micro level. The goal is to generate the development of perspectives and
        skills that enable all people, regardless of racial location, to be
        active initiators of change. Since all individuals who live within a
        racist system are enmeshed in its relations, this means that all are
        responsible for either perpetuating or transforming that system.
        However, although all individuals play a role in keeping the system
        active, the responsibility for change is not equally shared. White
        racism is ultimately a white problem and the burden for interrupting it
        belongs to white people46. Conversations about Whiteness might best
        happen within the context of a larger conversation about racism. It is
        useful to start at the micro level of analysis, and move to the macro,
        from the individual out to the interpersonal, societal and
        institutional. Starting with the individual and moving outward to the
        ultimate framework for racism – Whiteness – allows for the pacing that
        is necessary for many white people for approaching the challenging study
        of race. In this way, a discourse on Whiteness becomes part of a process
        rather than an event47.
        <br>
        <br>
        Many white people have never been given direct or complex information
        about racism before, and often cannot explicitly see, feel, or
        understand it48. People of color are generally much more aware of racism
        on a personal level, but due to the wider society’s silence and denial
        of it, often do not have a macro-level framework from which to analyze
        their experiences49. Further, dominant society “assigns” different roles
        to different groups of color50, and a critical consciousness about
        racism varies not only between individuals within groups, but also
        between groups. For example, many African Americans relate having been
        “prepared” by parents to live in a racist society, while many Asian
        heritage people say that racism was never directly discussed in their
        homes51. A macro-level analysis may offer a framework to understand
        different interpretations and performances across and between racial
        groups. In this way, all parties benefit and efforts are not solely
        focused on whites (which works to re-center Whiteness).
        <br>
        <br>
        Talking directly about white power and privilege, in addition to
        providing much needed information and shared definitions, is also in
        itself a powerful interruption of common (and oppressive) discursive
        patterns around race. At the same time, white people often need to
        reflect upon racial information and be allowed to make connections
        between the information and their own lives. Educators can encourage and
        support white participants in making their engagement a point of
        analysis. White Fragility doesn’t always manifest in overt ways; silence
        and withdrawal are also functions of fragility. Who speaks, who doesn’t
        speak, when, for how long, and with what emotional valence are all keys
        to understanding the relational patterns that hold oppression in
        place52. Viewing white anger, defensiveness, silence, and withdrawal in
        response to issues of race through the framework of White Fragility may
        help frame the problem as an issue of stamina-building, and thereby
        guide our interventions accordingly.
