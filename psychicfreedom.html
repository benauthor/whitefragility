        Because race is constructed as residing in people of color, whites don’t
        bear the social burden of race. We move easily through our society
        without a sense of ourselves as racialized subjects<sup><a
            href="references.html#28">28</a></sup>. We see race as
        operating when people of color are present, but all-white spaces as
        “pure” spaces – untainted by race vis á vis the absence of the carriers
        of race (and thereby the racial polluters) – people of color. This
        perspective is perfectly captured in a familiar white statement, “I was
        lucky. I grew up in an all-white neighborhood so I didn’t learn anything
        about racism.” In this discursive move, whiteness gains its meaning
        through its purported lack of encounter with non-whiteness<sup><a
            href="references.html#29">29</a></sup>. Because
        racial segregation is deemed socially valuable while simultaneously
        unracial and unremarkable, we rarely, if ever, have to think about race
        and racism, and receive no penalty for not thinking about it. In fact,
        whites are more likely to be penalized (primarily by other whites) for
        bringing race up in a social justice context than for ignoring it
        (however, it is acceptable to bring race up indirectly and in ways that
        reinforce racist attitudes, i.e. warning other whites to stay away from
        certain neighborhoods, etc.). This frees whites from carrying the
        psychic burden of race. Race is for people of color to think about – it
        is what happens to “them” – they can bring it up if it is an issue for
        them (although if they do, we can dismiss it as a personal problem, the
        “race card”, or the reason for their problems). This allows whites to
        devote much more psychological energy to other issues, and prevents us
        from developing the stamina to sustain attention on an issue as charged
        and uncomfortable as race.
