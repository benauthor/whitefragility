          Although mainstream definitions of racism are typically some variation
          of individual “race prejudice”, which anyone of any race can have,
          Whiteness scholars define racism as encompassing economic, political,
          social, and cultural structures, actions, and beliefs that systematize
          and perpetuate an unequal distribution of privileges, resources and
          power between white people and people of color (Hilliard, 1992). This
          unequal distribution benefits whites and disadvantages people of color
          overall and as a group. Racism is not fluid in the U.S.; it does not
          flow back and forth, one day benefiting whites and another day (or
          even era) benefiting people of color. The direction of power between
          whites and people of color is historic, traditional, normalized, and
          deeply embedded in the fabric of U.S. society (Mills, 1999; Feagin,
          2006). Whiteness itself refers to the specific dimensions of racism
          that serve to elevate white people over people of color. This
          definition counters the dominant representation of racism in
          mainstream education as isolated in discrete behaviors that some
          individuals may or may not demonstrate, and goes beyond naming
          specific privileges (McIntosh, 1988). Whites are theorized as actively
          shaped, affected, defined, and elevated through their racialization
          and the individual and collective consciousness’ formed within it
          (Frankenberg, 1997; Morrison, 1992; Tatum, 1997). Recognizing that the
          terms I am using are not “theory neutral ‘descriptors’ but theory
          laden constructs inseparable from systems of injustice” (Allen, 1996,
          p.95), I use the terms white and Whiteness to describe a social
          process. Frankenberg (1993) defines Whiteness as multi-dimensional:

          <Br>
          <Br>
            > Whiteness is a location of structural advantage, of race
            privilege. Second, it is a ‘standpoint,’ a place from which White
            people look at ourselves, at others, and at society. Third,
            ‘Whiteness’ refers to a set of cultural practices that are usually
            unmarked and unnamed. (p.1)
            <br>
            <br>
              Frankenberg and other theorists (Fine, 1997; Dyer, 1997; Sleeter,
              1993; Van Dijk, 1993) use Whiteness to signify a set of locations
              that are historically, socially, politically and culturally
              produced, and which are intrinsically linked to dynamic relations
              of domination. Whiteness is thus conceptualized as a constellation
              of processes and practices rather than as a discrete entity (i.e.
              skin color alone). Whiteness is dynamic, relational, and operating
              at all times and on myriad levels. These processes and practices
              include basic rights, values, beliefs, perspectives and
              experiences purported to be commonly shared by all but which are
              actually only consistently afforded to white people. Whiteness
              Studies begin with the premise that racism and white privilege
              exist in both traditional and modern forms, and rather than work
              to prove its existence, work to reveal it. This article will
              explore the dynamics of one aspect of Whiteness and its effects,
              White Fragility.
