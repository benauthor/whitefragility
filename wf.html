        A large body of research about children and race demonstrates that
        children start to construct ideas about race very early; a sense of
        white superiority and knowledge of racial power codes appears to develop
        as early as pre-school<sup><a href="references.html#31">31</a></sup>.
        Marty<sup><a href="references.html#32">32</a></sup> states,
        <br>
        <br>
        <i>As in other Western nations, white children born in the United States
        inherit the moral predicament of living in a white supremacist society.
        Raised to experience their racially based advantages as fair and normal,
        white children receive little if any instruction regarding the
        predicament they face, let alone any guidance in how to resolve it.
        Therefore, they experience or learn about racial tension without
        understanding Euro-Americans’ historical responsibility for it and
        knowing virtually nothing about their contemporary roles in perpetuating
        it<sup><a href="references.html#33">33</a></sup>.</i>
        <br>
        <br>
        At the same time that it is ubiquitous, white superiority also remains
        unnamed and explicitly denied by most whites. If white children become
        adults who explicitly oppose racism, as do many, they often organize
        their identity around a denial of the racially based privileges they
        hold that reinforce racist disadvantage for others. What is particularly
        problematic about this contradiction is that white moral objection to
        racism increases white resistance to acknowledging complicity with it.
        In a white supremacist context, white identity in large part rests upon
        a foundation of (superficial) racial toleration and acceptance. Whites
        who position themselves as liberal often opt to protect what they
        perceive as their moral reputations, rather than recognize or change
        their participation in systems of inequity and domination. In so
        responding, whites invoke the power to choose when, how, and how much to
        address or challenge racism. Thus, pointing out white advantage will
        often trigger patterns of confusion, defensiveness and righteous
        indignation. When confronted with a challenge to white racial codes,
        many white liberals use the speech of self-defense<sup><a
            href="references.html#34">34</a></sup>. This discourse
        enables defenders to protect their moral character against what they
        perceive as accusation and attack while deflecting any recognition of
        culpability or need of accountability. Focusing on restoring their moral
        standing through these tactics, whites are able to avoid the question of
        white privilege<sup><a href="references.html#35">35</a></sup>.
        <br>
        <br>
        Those who lead whites in discussions of race may find the discourse of
        self-defense familiar. Via this discourse, whites position themselves as
        victimized, slammed, blamed, attacked, and being used as “punching
        bag[s]”<sup><a href="references.html#36">36</a></sup>. Whites who describe interactions in this way are responding
        to the articulation of counter narratives; nothing physically out of the
        ordinary has ever occurred in any inter-racial discussion that I am
        aware of. These self-defense claims work on multiple levels to: position
        the speakers as morally superior while obscuring the true power of their
        social locations; blame others with less social power for their
        discomfort; falsely position that discomfort as dangerous; and
        reinscribe racist imagery. This discourse of victimization also enables
        whites to avoid responsibility for the racial power and privilege they
        wield. By positioning themselves as victims of anti-racist efforts, they
        cannot be the beneficiaries of white privilege. Claiming that they have
        been treated unfairly via a challenge to their position or an
        expectation that they listen to the perspectives and experiences of
        people of color, they are able to demand that more social resources
        (such as time and attention) be channeled in their direction to help
        them cope with this mistreatment.
        <br>
        <br>
        A cogent example of White Fragility occurred recently during a workplace
        anti-racism training I co-facilitated with an inter-racial team. One of
        the white participants left the session and went back to her desk, upset
        at receiving (what appeared to the training team as) sensitive and
        diplomatic feedback on how some of her statements had impacted several
        people of color in the room. At break, several other white participants
        approached us (the trainers) and reported that they had talked to the
        woman at her desk, and she was very upset that her statements had been
        challenged. They wanted to alert us to the fact that she literally
        “might be having a heart-attack.” Upon questioning from us, they
        clarified that they meant this literally. These co-workers were sincere
        in their fear that the young woman might actually physically die as a
        result of the feedback. Of course, when news of the woman’s potentially
        fatal condition reached the rest of the participant group, all attention
        was immediately focused back onto her and away from the impact she had
        had on the people of color. As Vodde<sup><a
            href="references.html#37">37</a></sup> states, “If privilege is defined
        as a legitimization of one’s entitlement to resources, it can also be
        defined as permission to escape or avoid any challenges to this
        entitlement”<sup><a href="references.html#38">38</a></sup>.
        <br>
        <br>
        The language of violence that many whites use to describe anti-racist
        endeavors is not without significance, as it is another example of the
        way that White Fragility distorts and perverts reality. By employing
        terms that connote physical abuse, whites tap into the classic discourse
        of people of color (particularly African Americans) as dangerous and
        violent. This discourse perverts the actual direction of danger that
        exists between whites and others. The history of brutal, extensive,
        institutionalized and ongoing violence perpetrated by whites against
        people of color—slavery, genocide, lynching, whipping, forced
        sterilization and medical experimentation to mention a few—becomes
        profoundly trivialized when whites claim they don’t feel safe or are
        under attack when in the rare situation of merely talking about race
        with people of color. The use of this discourse illustrates how fragile
        and ill-equipped most white people are to confront racial tensions, and
        their subsequent projection of this tension onto people of color<sup><a
            href="references.html#39">39</a></sup>.
        Goldberg<sup><a href="references.html#40">40</a></sup> argues that the questions surrounding racial discourse should
        not focus so much on how true stereotypes are, but how the truth claims
        they offer are a part of a larger worldview that authorizes and
        normalizes forms of domination and control. Further, it is relevant to
        ask: Under what conditions are those truth claims clung to most
        tenaciously?
        <br>
        <br>
        Bonilla-Silva<sup><a href="references.html#41">41</a></sup> documents a manifestation of White Fragility in his
        study of color-blind white racism. He states, “Because the new racial
        climate in America forbids the open expression of racially based
        feelings, views, and positions, when whites discuss issues that make
        them uncomfortable, they become almost incomprehensible – I, I, I, I
        don’t mean, you know, but…- ”<sup><a
            href="references.html#42">42</a></sup>. Probing forbidden racial issues results
        in verbal incoherence - digressions, long pauses, repetition, and
        self-corrections. He suggests that this incoherent talk is a function of
        talking about race in a world that insists race does not matter. This
        incoherence is one demonstration that many white people are unprepared
        to engage, even on a preliminary level, in an exploration of their
        racial perspectives that could lead to a shift in their understanding of
        racism. This lack of preparedness results in the maintenance of white
        power because the ability to determine which narratives are authorized
        and which are suppressed is the foundation of cultural domination<sup><a
            href="references.html#43">43</a></sup>.
        Further, this lack of preparedness has further implications, for if
        whites cannot engage with an exploration of alternate racial
        perspectives, they can only reinscribe white perspectives as universal.
        <br>
        <br>
        However, an assertion that whites do not engage with dynamics of racial
        discourse is somewhat misleading. White people do notice the racial
        locations of racial others and discuss this freely among themselves,
        albeit often in coded ways. Their refusal to directly acknowledge this
        race talk results in a kind of split consciousness that leads to the
        incoherence Bonilla-Silva documents above<sup><a
            href="references.html#44">44</a></sup>. This denial also guarantees
        that the racial misinformation that circulates in the culture and frames
        their perspectives will be left unexamined. The continual retreat from
        the discomfort of authentic racial engagement in a culture infused with
        racial disparity limits the ability to form authentic connections across
        racial lines, and results in a perpetual cycle that works to hold racism
        in place.
