        White people in North America live in a social environment that protects
        and insulates them from race-based stress. This insulated environment of
        racial protection builds white expectations for racial comfort while at
        the same time lowering the ability to tolerate racial stress, leading to
        what I refer to as White Fragility. White Fragility is a state in which
        even a minimum amount of racial stress becomes intolerable, triggering a
        range of defensive moves. These moves include the outward display of
        emotions such as anger, fear, and guilt, and behaviors such as
        argumentation, silence, and leaving the stress-inducing situation. These
        behaviors, in turn, function to reinstate white racial equilibrium. This
        paper explicates the dynamics of White Fragility.
        <br>
        <br>
        I am a white woman. I am standing beside a black woman. We are facing a
        group of white people who are seated in front of us. We are in their
        workplace, and have been hired by their employer to lead them in a
        dialogue about race. The room is filled with tension and charged with
        hostility. I have just presented a definition of racism that includes
        the acknowledgment that whites hold social and institutional power over
        people of color. A white man is pounding his fist on the table. His face
        is red and he is furious. As he pounds he yells, “White people have been
        discriminated against for 25 years! A white person can’t get a job
        anymore!” I look around the room and see 40 employed people, all white.
        There are no people of color in this workplace. Something is happening
        here, and it isn’t based in the racial reality of the workplace. I am
        feeling unnerved by this man’s disconnection with that reality, and his
        lack of sensitivity to the impact this is having on my cofacilitator,
        the only person of color in the room. Why is this white man so angry?
        Why is he being so careless about the impact of his anger? Why are all
        the other white people either sitting in silent agreement with him or
        tuning out? We have, after all, only articulated a definition of racism.
        White people in North America live in a social environment that protects
        and insulates them from race-based stress.^1 Fine<sup><a
            href="references.html#1">1</a></sup> identifies this
        insulation when she observes “… how Whiteness accrues privilege and
        status; gets itself surrounded by protective pillows of resources and/or
        benefits of the doubt; how Whiteness repels gossip and voyeurism and
        instead demands dignity”. Whites are rarely without these “protective
        pillows,” and when they are, it is usually temporary and by choice. This
        insulated environment of racial privilege builds white expectations for
        racial comfort while at the same time lowering the ability to tolerate
        racial stress.

        For many white people, a single required multicultural education course
        taken in college, or required “cultural competency training” in their
        workplace, is the only time they may encounter a direct and sustained
        challenge to their racial understandings. But even in this arena, not
        all multicultural courses or training programs talk directly about
        racism, much less address white privilege. It is far more the norm for
        these courses and programs to use racially coded language such as
        “urban,” “inner city,” and “disadvantaged” but to rarely use “white” or
        “overadvantaged” or “privileged.” This racially coded language
        reproduces racist images and perspectives while it simultaneously
        reproduces the comfortable illusion that race and its problems are what
        “they” have, not us. Reasons why the facilitators of these courses and
        trainings may not directly name the dynamics and beneficiaries of racism
        range from the lack of a valid analysis of racism by white facilitators,
        personal and economic survival strategies for facilitators of color, and
        the overall pressure from management to keep the content comfortable and
        palatable for whites. However, if and when an educational program does
        directly address racism and the privileging of whites, common white
        responses include anger, withdrawal, emotional incapacitation, guilt,
        argumentation, and cognitive dissonance (all of which reinforce the
        pressure on facilitators to avoid directly addressing racism). So-called
        progressive whites may not respond with anger, but may still insulate
        themselves via claims that they are beyond the need for engaging with
        the content because they “already had a class on this” or “already know
        this.” These reactions are often seen in anti-racist education endeavors
        as forms of resistance to the challenge of internalized
        dominance<sup><a href="references.html#2">2</a></sup>.
        These reactions do indeed function as resistance, but it may be useful
        to also conceptualize them as the result of the reduced psychosocial
        stamina that racial insulation inculcates. I call this lack of racial
        stamina “White Fragility.”

        ^1: Although white racial insulation is somewhat mediated by social
        class (with poor and working class urban whites being generally less
        racially insulated than suburban or rural whites), the larger social
        environment insulates and protects whites as a group through
        institutions, cultural representations, media, school textbooks, movies,
        advertising, dominant discourses, etc.

        Although mainstream definitions of racism are typically some variation
        of individual “race prejudice”, which anyone of any race can have,
        Whiteness scholars define racism as encompassing economic, political,
        social, and cultural structures, actions, and beliefs that systematize
        and perpetuate an unequal distribution of privileges, resources and
        power between white people and people of color<sup><a
            href="references.html#3">3</a></sup>. This unequal
        distribution benefits whites and disadvantages people of color overall
        and as a group. Racism is not fluid in the U.S.; it does not flow back
        and forth, one day benefiting whites and another day (or even era)
        benefiting people of color. The direction of power between whites and
        people of color is historic, traditional, normalized, and deeply
        embedded in the fabric of U.S. society<sup><a href="references.html#4">4</a></sup>. Whiteness itself refers to the
        specific dimensions of racism that serve to elevate white people over
        people of color. This definition counters the dominant representation of
        racism in mainstream education as isolated in discrete behaviors that
        some individuals may or may not demonstrate, and goes beyond naming
        specific privileges.<sup><a href="references.html#5">5</a></sup> Whites are theorized as actively shaped, affected,
        defined, and elevated through their racialization and the individual and
        collective consciousness’ formed within it<sup><a
            href="references.html#6">6</a></sup>. Recognizing that the terms
        I am using are not “theory neutral ‘descriptors’ but theory laden
        constructs inseparable from systems of injustice”<sup><a
            href="references.html#7">7</a></sup>, I use the terms
        white and Whiteness to describe a social process.
        Frankenberg<sup><a href="references.html#8">8</a></sup> defines
        Whiteness as multi-dimensional:
        <br>
        <br>
        Whiteness is a location of structural advantage, of race privilege.
        Second, it is a ‘standpoint,’ a place from which White people look at
        ourselves, at others, and at society. Third, ‘Whiteness’ refers to a set
        of cultural practices that are usually unmarked and unnamed.
        Frankenberg and other theorists<sup><a href="references.html#9">9</a></sup> use Whiteness to signify a set of
        locations that are historically, socially, politically and culturally
        produced, and which are intrinsically linked to dynamic relations of
        domination. Whiteness is thus conceptualized as a constellation of
        processes and practices rather than as a discrete entity (i.e. skin
        color alone). Whiteness is dynamic, relational, and operating at all
        times and on myriad levels. These processes and practices include basic
        rights, values, beliefs, perspectives and experiences purported to be
        commonly shared by all but which are actually only consistently afforded
        to white people. Whiteness Studies begin with the premise that racism
        and white privilege exist in both traditional and modern forms, and
        rather than work to prove its existence, work to reveal it. This article
        will explore the dynamics of one aspect of Whiteness and its effects,
        White Fragility.
