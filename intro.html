        White people in North America live in a social environment that protects
        and insulates them from race-based stress. This insulated environment of
        racial protection builds white expectations for racial comfort while at
        the same time lowering the ability to tolerate racial stress, leading to
        what I refer to as White Fragility. White Fragility is a state in which
        even a minimum amount of racial stress becomes intolerable, triggering a
        range of defensive moves. These moves include the outward display of
        emotions such as anger, fear, and guilt, and behaviors such as
        argumentation, silence, and leaving the stress-inducing situation. These
        behaviors, in turn, function to reinstate white racial equilibrium. This
        paper explicates the dynamics of White Fragility.

          I am a white woman. I am standing beside a black woman. We are facing
          a group of white people who are seated in front of us. We are in their
          workplace, and have been hired by their employer to lead them in a
          dialogue about race. The room is filled with tension and charged with
          hostility. I have just presented a definition of racism that includes
          the acknowledgment that whites hold social and institutional power
          over people of color. A white man is pounding his fist on the table.
          His face is red and he is furious. As he pounds he yells, “White
          people have been discriminated against for 25 years! A white person
          can’t get a job anymore!” I look around the room and see 40 employed
          people, all white. There are no people  of color in this workplace.
          Something is happening here, and it isn’t based in the racial reality
          of the workplace. I am feeling unnerved by this man’s disconnection
          with that reality, and his lack of sensitivity to the impact this is
          having on my cofacilitator, the only person of color in the room. Why
          is this white man so angry? Why is he being so careless about the
          impact of his anger? Why are all the other white people either sitting
          in silent agreement with him or tuning out? We have, after all, only
          articulated a definition of racism.
